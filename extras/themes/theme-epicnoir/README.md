## EpicNoir RetroPie Theme

This is a modern dark RetroPie theme based on original ideas by Chicuelo and brought to life in collaboration with Nick L (c64-dev).

Edits made by Jetup13
Deacreased file sizes by nearly half, added systems, and made edits to make it viewable on smaller 480x320 devices like Odroid Go Advanced, RGB10, RK2020, RG351P, ect.
